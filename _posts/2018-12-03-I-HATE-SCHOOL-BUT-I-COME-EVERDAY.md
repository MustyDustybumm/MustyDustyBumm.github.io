##  1st reason 
I come to school because i hate being home. Like I love being home but I hate not being able to leave the house to see my friends. 


## 2nd reason 
I want my parents to see me succeed. I will graduate and be the first to graduate out of my mom and dad. I want to go to college to become something and be someone! I do not want to be someone who doesn’t get paid good and doesn’t have enough money to support a family.
